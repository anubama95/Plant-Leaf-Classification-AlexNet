## Plant-Leaf-Classification-AlexNet

Plant Leaf Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network-AlexNet Implementation

### Requirements
    Python 3.x
    Tensorflow=1.14.0
    Keras=1.12
    Numpy=1.17.2
    Scipy=1.3.1
    MAtplotlib=3.1.1
    OpenCv=4.1.1.26
    ScikitLearn=0.20

This application uses a modified AlexNet architecture to classify among 33 classes of healthy and diseased crops.
Only 25 classes were used from the Plant Village dataset. The other 8 classes are of Groundnut leaf, which are collected in real time. 

### Convolutional Neural Network
A CNN is comprised of one or more convolutional layers and then followed by one or more fully connected layers as in a standard multilayer neural network
1. Convolution
2. Pooling
3. Fully Connected
4. Weights
